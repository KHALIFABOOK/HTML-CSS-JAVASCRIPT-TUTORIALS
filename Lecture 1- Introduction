<h1>NASA MARS MISSION</h1>
<p>The Mars 2020 rover mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet.
The Mars 2020 mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key questions about the potential for life 
on Mars. The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also 
searching for signs of past microbial life itself. The Mars 2020 rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most 
promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a "cache" on the surface of Mars. The mission also provides opportunities to gather
knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method 
for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques,
and characterizing weather, dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working 
on Mars. </p>

<h1> SAVE ENVIRONMENT </h1>
<p>Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect of climate 
change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.
Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably.[3] But more accurately, global warming is the mainly human-caused
increase in global surface temperatures and its projected continuation,[4] while climate change includes both global warming and its 
effects, such as changes in precipitation.[5] While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming,[6] many observed changes
since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia </p>
